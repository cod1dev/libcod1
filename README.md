This test branch is for the 1.5 Linux server.

It is an attempt to let the 1.1 client play without altering its movements.

In the current state, it works except for some actions such as:
- "prone jump"
- stance switch speed

But sometimes, during killcam, the server crashes (see the Discord server for info)

This branch doesn't contain all the features of the main one for 1.1, so the wiki doesn't fully apply
